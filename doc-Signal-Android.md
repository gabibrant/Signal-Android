Abstract
---------
This chapter aims to thoroughly describe the architecture of the Signal Private Messenger for Android software, covering general aspects such as its stakeholders, context, development and deployment views, and evolution perspective. The stakeholder analysis section details the types of influencer's who have any impact with the Signal's architecture, like developers, enterprises and final users. The context view explains the interactions between the software and its environment. The development view and deployment views describe the software development process and the runtime environment respectively. And finally, the evolution perspective relates the evolution, variability, performance & scaling the user community acceptance and perspectives of Signal Private Messenger.

Introduction
------------

Signal Private Messenger is an **encrypted communications app** for secure and private communication with friends. It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include images and video messages, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. Signal uses standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Signal users. The applications include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their messaging correspondents and the integrity of the data channel. In addition, a Chrome app that can link with a Signal client has been released.

Signal is maintained and run by Open Whisper Systems, a small team of dedicated grant-funded developers, along with a large community of volunteer Open Source contributors that surround the project. All of the source code and files for this project are publicly hosted on GitHub, and anyone can get involved and contribute.

According to GitTrends.io, the repository was created in the end of 2011 and has a moderated growing rate with more than 7.5k stars, considered one of the 700 most popular repositories in the Github platform.

Stakeholders
------------
Stakeholders are the people, groups and/or organizations that have interest or concern in an organization. Stakeholders can affect or be affected by the organization's actions, objectives and policies. Rozanski and Woods discuss 11 types of stakeholders in their book.

Signal is developed by *Open Whisper Systems*, a software organization founded by Moxie Marlinspike in 2013. The organization is funded by a combination of donations and grants, and all of its products are published as free and open-source software.

Context
------------

The context view of a system defines the relationships, dependencies and interactions between the system and its environment. This environment includes the people, systems and external entities with which it interacts. It defines what the system does and what the system does not do.

The Open Whisper Systems community is working to advance the state of the art for secure communication, while simultaneously making it easy for everyone to use. They aim to make mass surveillance of private messaging a thing of the past, and to do that their biggest focus is currently user adoption; we want Signal (or something as secure as Signal) to be as ubiquitous as other messaging applications such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.


Development View 
----------------
According to Rozanski and Woods, the development view concerns "code structure and dependencies, build and configuration management of deliverables, systemwide design constraints, and system-wide standards to ensure technical integrity". 

According to GitTrends.io, the Signal Private Messenger has only one user as truck factor: Moxie Marlinspike (moxie0), responsible for more than 94% of the files in the master branch.

### BitHub Rewards
Since Signal is a Open Source software, they have a method to reward people who volunteer to contribute to the project though BitHub, which is a service that will automatically pay a percentage of Bitcoin funds for every submission to a GitHub repository. It is possible to find all details [here](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/BitHub-Rewards).

### Code Guidelines
The Signal Private Messeger project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which each have different code guidelines. Moxie Marlinspike has provided standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable code style where contributors of the project must adhere to. This code guide can be found [here](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines). 


Evolution Perspective
---------------------
Signal Private Messenger is the successor of an encrypted voice calling app called RedPhone and an encrypted texting program called TextSecure. The beta versions of RedPhone and TextSecure were first launched in May 2010 by Whisper Systems, a startup company co-founded by security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson. The company also produced a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data. All of these were proprietary enterprise mobile security software and were only available for Android.

In November 2011, Whisper Systems announced that it had been acquired by Twitter. Twitter released TextSecure as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license in December 2011. RedPhone was also released under the same license in July 2012. Marlinspike later left Twitter and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative Open Source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone.

In February 2014, Open Whisper Systems introduced the second version of their TextSecure Protocol (now Signal Protocol), which added end-to-end encrypted group chat and instant messaging capabilities to TextSecure. Toward the end of July 2014, Open Whisper Systems announced plans to unify its RedPhone and TextSecure applications as Signal. In November 2015, the TextSecure and RedPhone applications on Android were merged to become Signal for Android.

Reception
----------
Signal was well recepted by the security community. In October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) included Signal in their updated surveillance self-defense guide and afterwards, in November of the same year, Signal received a perfect score of the EFF's messaging scorecard. 

Edward Sowden has endorsed Signal on multiple occasions. In his keynote speech at SXSW in March 2014, he praised Signal's predecessors (TextSecure and RedPhone) for their ease-of-use. During an interview with The New Yorker in October 2014, he recommended using "anything from Moxie Marlinspike and Open Whisper Systems." During a remote appearance at an event hosted by Ryerson University and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression in March 2015, Snowden said that Signal is "very good" and that he knew the security model. Asked about encrypted messaging apps during a Reddit AMA in May 2015, he recommended Signal. In November 2015, Snowden tweeted that he used Signal "every day."
